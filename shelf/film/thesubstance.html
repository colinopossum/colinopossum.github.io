            <p> My girlfriend and I went into this expecting a regular horror movie. It is not. Its full on body horror, and its both very gross and absolutley mesmerizing. As a big fan of The Thing, I couldnt reccommend this movie more.</p>
            <p> The message is my favorite part of the movie, and what makes it stand out. I love the disgusting commodification of youth, the huge commercial text of our characters names, the sports car mix as Sue suits up in her new body. Its like I am watching an ad for some new product - and thats what it is - she is product to hollywood. </p>
            <p> This is all kinda off the dome, so this wont be some kind of dissertation. The movie is a grand slam in all catagories and should not be missed. Im sad it took me this long to watch it lol.</p>
