            <p> Reccommended by Madelynns step dad to watch as we all sat in the living room. Its definitely one of those "dad" movies - and no shade either. It is what it is lol. </p>
            <p> Fun fact - this movie had to <a href="https://angelsanddemons.web.cern.ch/index.html"> make a website to explain to the public that the "science" in the movie is all fiction and doesnt pose a threat.</a> No, gam gam, terrorists arent going to CERN to steal some antimatter and use it to destroy us. </p>
            <p> This wouldnt be the only time CERN enters the spotlight of mass conspiracy theories - so it was interesting to see it in a hollywood film. Thats where the fun stops for me, mostly. </p>
            <p> The plot is predictable. Tom Hanks delivers a cardboard performance of his symbology genius character, Robert Langdon. The assassin that drives the plot forward refuses to kill Robert because...he wasnt instructed to and it would be a sin. Disregard the pile of corpses this guy leaves in his wake wherever he goes. How convenient! I never got the sense that their were any stakes for our MC. </p>
            <p> I learned what conclave was though, so that was cool. </p>
