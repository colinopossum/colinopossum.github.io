            <p> This was my second watch of this movie, and man. What a fuckin good one. Thought provoking all the way through. First time I watched it I really wasnt that impressed, though I cant remember exactly what failed to impress me. Maybe I was just in a sour mood and the movie couldnt have possibly moved me. </p>
            <p> But now? Oh shit. Totally different. Theres a message here about the rot that can exist in communities, rot that lies beneath corrupt religious practices that end up doing more damage to their towns than good. </p>
            <p> The rot is symbolized by the constant burning of the earth underneath silent hill. When night takes the town, the ash flakes off the ground and the buildings. Wallpaper is stripped away to reveal rust and mine shaft like scaffolding. You can see that beneath the surface, this place is not safe. I mean, it also just looks fucking creepy, but this message applies to plenty of southern towns. </p>
            <p> Maybe I find some kind of cathartic pleasure in seeing religious extremism fly in the face of the ones who practice it through the form of ultra violent retribution in its victim. A child, burned by a church who believed it was a demon. </p>
            <p> Idk man. The soundtrack, Pyramid heads kills, the vibe, the message. It all kinda fuckin hits in 2025. </p>
            <p> ps, dont have a single silent hill game under my belt. So take that as you will lol. </p>
