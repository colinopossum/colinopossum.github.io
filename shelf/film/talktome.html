            <p> Another movie in our quest to catch up on some horror films weve missed. We do this every Halloween. All I could remember about this film is that is what made by Rakaraka, the guy on Youtube who would dress up as Ronald Mcdonald and cause absolute chaos in hilarious skits. </p>
            <p> Its a really good film. I appreciate that this film doesnt hold back in showing you the main character, consumed by grief, is not a nice person. She is actually quite selfish, and this is a recipe for disaster when she is given access to a hand that allows you to talk to the dead. </p>
            <p> The peer pressure to take the challenge of being possessed hits close. Reminds me of the internet challenges of the early 2010s like the cinnamon challenge. Earlier than that, the bloody mary mirror challenge. Its pretty clever! </p>
