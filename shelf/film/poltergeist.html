            <p> had the pleasure of watching this for free at a local library! Its cool to see the blueprint that made movies like insidious, and the conjuring possible. special effects were killer. I didnt realize scary movie 2 made fun of it until the clown takes the kid under the bed. and the ghost ya know, tries to assault the mom. It would have been a cool twist at the end (spoilers) if the entire united states just started erupting in similar fashion. It is colonized land, after all. there are graves, marked or not, under all our feet. </p>
