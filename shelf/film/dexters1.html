            <p> Fresh off watching ressurections, I forgot how sex forward this show is. You would think its a HBO show. Not that I mind, I was just surpised. </p>
            <p> Ive been vocally stimming the outro song for the show for days and DAYS. Ill just walk around the apartment and sing it randomly. Now my girlfriend does it too. Its so great. </p>
            <p> Also forgot how catchy the intro theme is. </p>
