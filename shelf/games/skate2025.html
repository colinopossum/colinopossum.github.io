            <p> While it is early access, I am going to judge the game now. And honestly, its just kinda meh. It reminds me of when Fallout 76 first came out. A lifeless world and meaningless tasks, and a well developed store front to get more money out of you. Its great if you wanna chill and use it as a chatroom for friends but, idk. It gets boring, really really fast. And the dialogue is fucking cringe and annoying. </p>
            <p> Its just another example of taking an iconic, addicting gameplay loop and trying to milk it for all its worth. Destiny does it with Halos DNA. Fallout 76 did it with Fallout 4s core loops. Its fucking trash. </p>
