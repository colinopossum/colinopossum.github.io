            <h4> Halo Reach | Xbox One - Master Chief Collection</h4>
            <h4> finished | [unfinished, but will return] | never coming back </h4>
            <h4> rating [N/A] </h4>

            <p> Ive beaten this game countless times when it first launched on 360, and I love it each and every time. There isnt a rating here because I didnt finish it. For "remember reach" day this year I got my twin brother online to play a couple missions of the campaign. We ended up staying up till like, 3am and half way through the story. </p>
            <p> I was in awe of the enemy AI. Man, we used to have it good huh? The way the enemy AI reacts to the way you play by either flanking, or running away if a certain enemy is killed (like an elite) - or an elite with a energy sword charging you when your shields are down. Its so fucking impressive. </p>
            <p> Had such a fun time with my twin. A night full of laughs and pure halo chaos. Need to finish the fight on reach with him again when I can find the time. </p>
