            <h4> Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove | Nintendo Switch </h4>
            <h4> [finished] | unfinished, but will return | never coming back </h4>
            <h4> rating [*****] </h4>

            <p> spoilers if you keep reading on, be warned. finished with an * - I completed the main story of shovel knight but none of the side ones. </p>
            <p> finally got around to playing the indie darling. I loved every second of this brutal journey. the score, the themes, [save her]. I didnt grow up in the NES era - mine was n64 and gameboy. nevertheless, I still felt its call to remember how powerful a game like this can be despite its bit limitations. </p>
            <p> campfire dreams play out after each level completion - to catch your beloved shield knight as she falls to the ground from the heavens above. all around you are enemies trying to prevent you from doing so. are we reliving an awful memory where we failed to catch her, and hoping it plays out different this time? or is it preparation? this story telling technique kept me hooked the ENTIRE game. i personally felt like I needed to save shield knight, and in the end you do. you catch her, and not only is she saved but her abilities perfectly complement yours, allowing you to finish off the final boss. its glorious, and a triumph for a trope that is often so played out at this point. well fucking done. </p>
