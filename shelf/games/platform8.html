            <p> first off, kudos to the devs for changing the formula in the sequel to exit 8, instead of just opting to pump out a billion sequels that are all the same. becuase given the price model, they easily could and make bank. I respect that tremendously. </p>
            <p> this game is much scarier than exit 8, with visuals and anomalies that will trip you out more so then they did in the previous game. less of a focus on noticing subtle changes in wallpaper. its more about avoiding collision with scary entities, set on a moving subway train. there could easily be a metaphor here about social anxiety in cramped public spaces, privacy, and the overbearing mundanity of rush hour metro. there are genuinely clever scares here, perfect for the person who often touts themselves as unscarable, having seen it all (me). </p>
