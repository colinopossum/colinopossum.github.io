            <p> Honestly? This is such a great homage to Metroid. Its short and sweet and doesnt waste your time at all. Couple of things I really liked. Exploration is rewarded well, with my favorite reward being the color schemes you can pick up to change the entire look of the game. I think I changed it like 20 times through my playthrough. story is hilarious and never failed to atleast get a chuckle out of me. satisfying combat and world design, with a steady feed of power ups. sound design is stellar. love the shooting sfx. If you love Metroid, or more specifically, the metroid part of metroidvanias, this is a must play. </p>
