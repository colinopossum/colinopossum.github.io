            <p> A memorable experience I was lucky enough to have with 3 other close friends - all whom cherish the Dark Souls series. Its quite fun if you are a fan of the addictive nature of rogue likes. Its also commendable that theres zero microtransactions for what is basically a live service game. The soundtrack bangs. Caligos track being a personal fav. Also, is without a doubt the best dragon fight in the souls series by far. Giving it 3 stars because while I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, I dont see myself coming back to it that often. The ending satisfied me. I got 60ish hours of fun out of it :] would highly rec if youre a big fan of elden ring AND have a couple buddies looking to have some fun. </p>
