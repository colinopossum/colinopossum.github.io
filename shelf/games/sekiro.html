            <p> <em> "Hesitation is defeat" </em> </p>
            <p> This game has a profound, zen like quality to the way it teaches you about its game mechanics. There is only one way forward. It perfectly recaptures that Dark Souls 1 magic for me but through a different lens, and for me that's really important, because I have severe souls like fatigue. Ive been around in the genre since Dark Souls was released as a free Xbox Live game on 360, for context. While at first the parrying can be difficult to get down but so, so rewarding to master. One of if not my favorite game I have played in 2025. This will be a game I play every year from now on. </p>
