            <p> for a game that cost me 4 dollars, this was incredible. it reminded me of the PT demo. ive never played a "observe and see what changes" type of game before..I dont even know what you would call it to be frank. but it completely nails its atmosphere, driving you on edge by its unending, merciless routine set in a subway metro that is way too clean. whats going to change next? will it scare me? </p>
