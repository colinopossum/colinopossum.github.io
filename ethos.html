            <p> Howdy, names Colin. This is my personal website I started working on to develop my skills in web development. I also started this because of my exhaustion with social media platforms as a whole. </p>
            <p> Social media as we knew it before is completely different now. You see more ads, news, bite sized videos designed to keep you scrolling, endlessly. Hardly anyone actually posts a random thought, or feeling. If they do, its buried underneath a feed of shit. </p> 
            <p> Platforms like facebook, twitter, instagram, and youtube have lost all sincerity. </p>
            <p> This is an adoption of the philosophy that owning your power as a user on the internet is more important now, more than ever. </p> 
            <p> Just by learning some simple HTML and CSS, I now have a website that will be home to anything I want to share to the internet, and I am in complete control over it. It may not be as flashy or feature rich, but its exactly what I want. </p>
            <p> I mean, it is hosted on github pages for now - but I own the code. I can take it anywhere else I want! </p> <br>
