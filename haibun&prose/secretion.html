            <p>A warm day starts to cool off. I visited my family. My 2 year old nephew is a mesmer. I find myself falling into orbit around him as I watch him learn to navigate the world. Once home, Madelynn and I make a late dinner. Time slips, and before I know it, its almost 2am. A storm taps on the window.</p> 

            <p> I begin by sitting on the porch, cross legged. I shape the cosmic mudra but I do not find my heart there. The world is a deluge. Rain obfuscates the natural sounds of the night and I am floundering. After some time, my vision begins to blur. The shape of trees turn to suggestion as the world shifts into grey shapes. One cricket, close to my right chirps steadily outside the cacophony. I begin to count with each chirp. Twenty-two is the number I reach before I lose myself. A woman screaming in the dark. I run after her - my bare feet sloshing in the rain. I surface. </p>

            <p> ”Secretion.” </p>

            <p> The cricket, having waited for the thunder to pass; begins his steady chirp again. </p>

            <p> 
            endless waves <br>
            peaks blossom <br>
            at their height <br>
