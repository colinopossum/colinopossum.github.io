            3.3.25
            alone  
            one star 
            is enough.

            -

            3.4.25

            the absence  
            before clouds 
            crescent moon

            -

            3.11.25

            daytime moon 
            the white blossoms  
            of pear trees

            -

            3.14.25

            the blood moon 
            fades into white light 
            radiant forest

            -

            3.14.25

            so soon… 
            pear tree petals 
            in the wind 

            -

            3.8.25

            the drifting fade 
            of cloud strokes 
            absence blooms 

            -

            3.28.25

            alone 
            a black tadpole 
            hidden in light

            -

            4.2.25

            the growing shadow 
            of the canopy 

            -

            4.11.25

            lightning blooms  
            to feel a cloud and fade 

            -

            4.14.25

            watching it rise  
            from the deep… 
            a bright bubble 

            -

            4.15.25

            waves end
            a dripping branch
            over water

            -

            4.17.25

            closed blinds
            a pillar of light
            bleeds in

            -

            4.23.25

            minds quiet 
            cloud edges 
            wisp away 

            -

            4.26,25

            silencing my mind  
            the forest floods 
            with birdsong   

            -

            4.28.25

            sitting -
            a tree resting
            within ivy

            -


            5.6.25

            spring clouds -
            resting in the grass 
            a white moth 

            -

            5.11.25

            red light
            in their low beams
            rain falls 

            -

            5.14.25

            rippling lake -
            a nameless branch
            pierces through

            -

            cutting off the radio
            to watch the moon 

            -

            5.18.25

            only seen
            from within
            fireflies

            -

            5.20.25

            crickets - 
            a ghost cries
            to himself

            -

            5.26.25

            once i stop
            they start
            frog song
