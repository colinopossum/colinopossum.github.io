            <p> Howdy, names Colin. This is my personal website I started working on to develop my skills in web development. I also started this because of my exhaustion with social media platforms as a whole. </p>
            <p> Social media as we knew it before is completely different now. You see more ads, news, bite sized videos designed to keep you scrolling. Hardly anyone actually posts a random thought, or feeling. </p> 
            <p> If you do post, you <em> always </em> have a like button underneath it - and my brain hates that. I get too swept up in seeing likes grow in number, checking over and over if what I said mattered. I let it effect me too much. </p>
            <p> In my perspective, platforms like facebook, twitter, instagram, and youtube have lost all sincerity. </p>
            <p> This is an adoption of the philosophy that owning your power as a user on the internet is more important now, more than ever. Youve seen the ads from squarespace, or wordpress: "Let us build your website!" - but its always more than that. They lock you inside the engine, so whatever they built isnt yours if you dont pay. They dont want you to know that you can do all this yourself. </p> 
            <p> Just by learning some simple HTML, I now have a website that will be home to anything I want to share to the internet, and I am in complete control over it. It may not be as flashy or feature rich, but its exactly what I want. </p>
            <p> I mean, it is hosted on github pages for now - but I own the code. I can take it anywhere else I want. Anyways, I appreciate ya if you read that diatribe. I hope you enjoy the site :] </p> <br>
